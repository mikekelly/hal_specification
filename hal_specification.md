## Summary
HAL is a simple format that gives a consistent and easy way to
hyperlink between resources in your API.

Adopting HAL will make your API explorable, and its documentation easily
disocverable from within the API itself. In short, it will make your API
easier to work with and therefore more attractive to client developers.

APIs that adopt HAL can be easily served and consumed using open source
libraries available for most major programming languages. It's also
simple enough that you can just deal with it as you would any other
JSON.

## General Description
HAL provides a set of conventions for expressing hyperlinks in either
JSON or XML.

**The rest of a HAL document is just plain old JSON or XML.**

Instead of using ad-hoc structures, or spending valuable time designing
your own format; you can adopt HAL's conventions and focus on building
and documenting the data and transitions that make up your API.

HAL is a little bit like HTML for machines, in that it is generic and
designed to drive many different types of application via hyperlinks.
The difference is that HTML has features for helping 'human actors' move
through a web application to achieve their goals, whereas HAL is
intended for helping 'automated actors' move through a web API to
achieve their goals.

Having said that, **HAL is actually very human-friendly too**. Its
conventions make the documentation for an API discoverable from the API
messages themselves.  This makes it possible for developers to jump
straight into a HAL-based API and explore its capabilities, without the
cognitive overhead of having to map some out-of-band documentation onto
their journey.

## Examples

The example below is how you might represent a collection of orders with
hal+json. Things to look for:

* The URI of the main resource being represented ('/orders') expressed
  with a self link
* The 'next' link pointing to the next page of orders
* A templated link called 'ea:find' for searching orders by id
* The multiple 'ea:admin' link objects contained in an array
* Two properties of the orders collection; 'currentlyProcessing' and
  'shippedToday'
* Embedded order resources with their own links and properties
* The compact URI (curie) named 'ea' for expanding the name of the
  links to their documentation URL

### application/hal+json
```javascript
{
    "_links": {
        "self": { "href": "/orders" },
        "curies": [{ "name": "ea", "href": "http://example.com/docs/rels/{rel}", "templated": true }],
        "next": { "href": "/orders?page=2" },
        "ea:find": {
            "href": "/orders{?id}",
            "templated": true
        },
        "ea:admin": [{
            "href": "/admins/2",
            "title": "Fred"
        }, {
            "href": "/admins/5",
            "title": "Kate"
        }]
    },
    "currentlyProcessing": 14,
    "shippedToday": 20,
    "_embedded": {
        "ea:order": [{
            "_links": {
                "self": { "href": "/orders/123" },
                "ea:basket": { "href": "/baskets/98712" },
                "ea:customer": { "href": "/customers/7809" }
            },
            "total": 30.00,
            "currency": "USD",
            "status": "shipped"
        }, {
            "_links": {
                "self": { "href": "/orders/124" },
                "ea:basket": { "href": "/baskets/97213" },
                "ea:customer": { "href": "/customers/12369" }
            },
            "total": 20.00,
            "currency": "USD",
            "status": "processing"
        }]
    }
}
```

## The HAL Model

The HAL conventions revolve around representing two simple concepts: _Resources_ and _Links_.

### Resources
Resources have:

* Links (to URIs)
* Embedded Resources (i.e. other resources contained within them)
* State (your bog standard JSON or XML data)

### Links
Links have:

* A target (a URI)
* A relation aka. 'rel' (the name of the link)
* A few other optional properties to help with deprecation, content
  negotiation, etc.

Below is an image that roughly illustrates how a HAL representation is
structured:

![The HAL Information model][4]

## How HAL is used in APIs
HAL is designed for building APIs in which clients navigate around the
resources by following links.

Links are identfied by link relations. Link relations are the lifeblood
of a hypermedia API: they are how you tell client developers about
what resources are available and how they can be interacted with, and
they are how the code they write will select which link to traverse.

Link relations are not just an identifying string in HAL, though. They
are actually URLs, which developers can follow in order to read the
documentation for a given link. This is what is known as
"discoverability". The idea is that a developer can enter into your API,
read through documentation for the available links, and then
follow-their-nose through the API.

HAL encourages the use of link relations to:

*   Identify links and embedded resources within the representation
*   Infer the expected structure and meaning of target resources
*   Signalling what requests and representations can be submitted to target resources

## How to serve HAL
HAL has a media type for both the JSON and XML variants, whos names are
`application/hal+json` and `application/hal+xml` respectively.

When serving HAL over HTTP, the `Content-Type` of the response should
contain the relevant media type name.

## The structure of a HAL document

### Minimum valid document
A HAL document must at least contain an empty resource.

An empty JSON object:

```javascript
{}
```

### Resources
In most cases, resources should have a self URI

Represened via a 'self' link:

```javascript
{
    "_links": {
        "self": { "href": "/example_resource" }
    }
}
```

### Links
Links must be contained directly within a resource:

Links are represented as JSON object contained within a `_links` hash
that must be a direct property of a resource object:

```javascript
{
    "_links": {
        "next": { "href": "/page=2" }
    }
}
```

#### Link Relations
Links have a relation (aka. 'rel'). This indicates the semantic -
the meaning - of a particular link.

Link rels are the main way of distinguishing between a resource's links.

It's basically just a key within the `_links` hash, associating the link meaning
(the 'rel') with the link object that contains data like the actual 'href' value:

```javascript
{
    "_links": {
        "next": { "href": "/page=2" }
    }
}
```

#### API Discoverability
Link rels should be URLs which reveal documentation about the
given link, making them "discoverable".  URLs are generally quite long
and a bit nasty for use as keys. To get around this, HAL provides
"CURIEs" which are basically named tokens that you can define in the
document and use to express link relation URIs in a friendlier, more
compact fashion i.e.  `ex:widget` instead of
`http://example.com/rels/widget`. The details are available in the
section on CURIEs a bit further down.

### Representing Multiple Links With The Same Relation
A resource may have multiple links that share the same link relation.

For link relations that may have multiple links, we use an array of
links.

```javascript
{
    "_links": {
      "items": [{
          "href": "/first_item"
      },{
          "href": "/second_item"
      }]
    }
}
```

**Note:** If you're unsure whether the link should be singular, assume it
will be multiple. If you pick singular and find you need to change it,
you will need to create a new link relation or face breaking existing
clients.

### CURIEs

"CURIE"s help providing links to resource documentation.

HAL gives you a reserved link relation 'curies' which you can use to hint at the location of resource documentation.

```javascript
"_links": {
  "curies": [
    {
      "name": "doc",
      "href": "http://haltalk.herokuapp.com/docs/{rel}",
      "templated": true
    }
  ],

  "doc:latest-posts": {
    "href": "/posts/latest"
  }
}
```

There can be multiple links in the 'curies' section. They come with a 'name' and a templated 'href' which must
contain the `{rel}` placeholder.

Links in turn can then prefix their 'rel' with a CURIE name. Associating the `latest-posts` link with the `doc`
documentation CURIE results in a link 'rel' set to `doc:latest-posts`.

To retrieve documentation about the `latest-posts` resource, the client will expand the associated CURIE link
with the actual link's 'rel'. This would result in a URL `http://haltalk.herokuapp.com/docs/latest-posts` which
is expected to return documentation about this resource.


## To be continued...
This relatively informal specification of HAL is incomplete and still in
progress. For now, if you would like to have a full understanding please
read the [formal specification][13].

## RFC
The JSON variant of HAL (application/hal+json) has now been published as
an internet draft: [draft-kelly-json-hal][13].
