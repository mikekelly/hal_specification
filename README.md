# HAL - Hypertext Application Language

## A lean hypermedia type

HAL is a simple way of linking with JSON or XML.

It provides a set of conventions for expressing hyperlinks to, and embeddedness of, related resources - the rest of a HAL document is just plain old JSON or XML. 

This repo contains a formalised specification of HAL (see [hal\_specification.md][1]).

For a friendlier, more pracitcal introduction to HAL you can read this article: [JSON Linking with HAL][2].

## Discussion Group

If you have any questions or feedback about HAL, you can message the [HAL-discuss mailing list][3].
